Hello Dan

For the Case !!!= there was a large amount of debate wether this was 
1 token as !!!=
2 tokens as !! !=
3 tokens as ! ! !=
I decided to do it as 3 tokens since in the CD19 Lexical structure Grammar print out 

7. Other significant lexical items in CD19 are: semicolon (;) leftbracket ([)
rightbracket (]) comma (,) leftparen ( ( ) rightparen ( ) ) equals (=) plus (+)
minus (-) star (*) slash (/) percent (%) carat (^) less (<) greater (>) exclamation
(!) quote (â€œ) colon (:) dot (.)

Hense I understood this as each time a token can't be completed it is seen as an individual token, 
not clumped up together since that would require the code to read future tokens which a statemachine 
cannot do. That was my reasoning

Then my friend sent the email so now it seperates !!!!= into !!! != for those juicy "Bonus points" haha

Outside that it runs on the school computers and it should run find with a 
javac A1.java
into a 
java A1 test.txt
